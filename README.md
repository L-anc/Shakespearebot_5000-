William Shakespeare is perhaps the most famous poet and playwright of all time. Shakespeare is known for works such as Hamlet and his 154 sonnets. Shakespeareâ€™s poems are nice for generative modeling because they follow a specific format, known as the Shakespearean (or English) sonnet. Each sonnet is 14 lines, spread into 3 quatrains (section with 4 lines) followed by a couplet (section with 2 lines). The third quatrain is known as the volta and has a change in tone or content. Shakespearean sonnets have a particular rhyme scheme, which is abab cdcd efef gg. Shakespearean sonnets also follow a specific meter called iambic pentameter3. All lines are exactly 10 syllables long, and have a pattern of unstressed stress. The goal for this project is to generate poems that Shakespeare may have written by training a HMM on his 154 sonnets. His sonnets are available in the data file shakespeare.txt
